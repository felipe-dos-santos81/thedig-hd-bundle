"""Regenerate The Dig room backgrounds as
painted high-definition art at exactly 4x, re-import-safe.

Human-paced stages, each a subcommand:

  caption   observe every scene and insert room with the local vLLM and write
            its caption into rooms.yaml
  batch     render every captioned room through ComfyUI window by window,
            stitch, colour-match, fix up and check its geometry; promote it into
            the output tree when the geometry holds; re-render the rooms
            reviews.yaml rejects; write skip rooms as a nearest-neighbour 4x
  review    compare every promoted room with its source through the vLLM and
            write reviews.yaml
  verify    audit the output tree against the manifest, the 4x rule and the
            attempt records

The source tree is thedig-textures-exporter's output; its manifest.json (read by
source_tree) decides which rooms and objects exist. Services are external: vLLM
(Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B on :8000) and ComfyUI (:8188) are started by the user; this
driver only checks that they answer.
