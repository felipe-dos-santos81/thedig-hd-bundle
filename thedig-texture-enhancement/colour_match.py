"""Pull a render's colours toward its own source guide.

Rule "source-relative": the render's per-band Lab mean and spread move toward
the guide's (the de-dithered source, upscaled), blended by strength. There are
no anchors: the painted look keeps the game's colours, and the rooms of one
location already share the game's palette. Pure image maths on Pillow images
through a float sRGB <-> CIE Lab (D65) transform in numpy; knows no rooms or
files.

The transform is float end to end because Pillow's 8-bit Lab round trip is
lossy: it moves saturated colours by up to 39 levels even when nothing is
matched. Lab here is CIE L* (0-100), a* and b*.
