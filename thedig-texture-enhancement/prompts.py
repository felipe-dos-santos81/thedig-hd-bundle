Any further images are consecutive windows of the same room from left to right. Describe it for an artist who will repaint it in high definition with exactly the same composition. Report only what the images show; this is observation, not creative writing.
Use these short labelled sections:
SCENE: the kind of place (interior, exterior, close-up insert, map), its architecture and atmosphere.
VIEW: viewpoint, framing and perspective.
LAYOUT: the major objects and surfaces from left to right, each with its horizontal position as a fraction of the room's width (0 is the left edge, 1 the right edge) and its vertical position (0 top, 1 bottom), relative size and occlusion. Cover foreground, middle and background.
OBJECTS: doors, windows, openings, furniture and props, with their open or closed states; say absent if there are none.
LIGHTING: light sources, their direction, the exposure and the shadows. Dark areas stay dark.
PALETTE: the dominant colours of each major area.
TEXT: every piece of lettering that is legible, transcribed verbatim with its position; write none if there is none. Do not guess at illegible text.
INVARIANTS: the composition and object relationships that must survive repainting. Mark ambiguity instead of inventing detail.
The game draws its characters separately, so say "no people" unless people are painted into the background itself. Do not prescribe a style, lens or colour grade. Keep under 600 words.'''

Keep the exact composition. Every object, edge, opening and horizon stays where the reference puts it, at the same size and in the same perspective; nothing is moved, added, removed or resized. Add no people, creatures or characters that the reference does not show.
Keep the reference's colours, time of day, light sources and shadow pattern. Dark areas stay dark and flat black areas stay flat black.
Replace the dithering and blocky pixels with painted texture and fine detail that suit each material: wood grain, stone, cloth, foliage, metal, water, sky. No photograph, no 3D render, no pixel art, no border or frame.'''

In each pair the first image is one window of the authoritative original background of a 1992 hand-painted adventure game (smoothed and enlarged), and the second is the same window of a high-definition repaint. The last image is the whole repaint, downscaled. Judge fidelity first, then style. Painted texture and fine detail replacing the original's pixels is the goal and is never a reason to reject.
Reject when:
1. layout: an object, edge, opening or horizon is added, dropped, moved or resized, the perspective or framing changed, or a person, creature or character appears that the original lacks;
2. style: the repaint looks like a photograph or a 3D render, or keeps the original's flat, dithered pixels instead of painted detail;
3. lettering (close-up inserts only): legible lettering differs from the expected lettering below, or became illegible;
4. seams: a visible vertical seam, a doubled object or repeated detail where windows meet, or a jump in colour or texture between neighbouring windows in the whole repaint.
Return ONLY JSON: {"accepted": true or false, "issues": ["one specific problem: its window number, its screen position and a concrete correction"]}. Accept only if there are no significant problems; use an empty issues list when accepted. At most six issues.'''
