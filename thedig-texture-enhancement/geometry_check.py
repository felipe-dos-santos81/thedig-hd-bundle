"""The deterministic geometry check of a 4x render against its native source.

The re-import-safe gate: a render whose content slid, or that lost the
source's edges, is not promoted. Numpy maths on Pillow images; knows no files,
rooms or audit tree. Windows are native (x0, x1) column pairs; seam boundaries
are 4x columns.

Each measure has one job. Phase correlation finds a slid room or window (a
2-pixel shift reads as 2.0). Edge agreement finds lost or moved structure,
over the room and within each window: on the real art a 2-pixel shift still
keeps most edges within 1 pixel, so it is no shift detector.

Edge agreement has hysteresis. A source edge is strong above EDGE_THRESHOLD;
it is kept when the render has an edge above RENDER_EDGE_THRESHOLD within
1 pixel. Resampling to 4x and box-filtering back is not the identity, and it
weakens marginal edges (room 95's sea) under a single shared threshold.
